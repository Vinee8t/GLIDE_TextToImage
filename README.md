Open AI GLIDE to generate images from the given text. GLIDE stands for Guided Language-to-Image Diffusion for Generation and Editing. 
It is a 3.5 billion parameter text-to-image generation model and has trained a smaller model at 64x64 resolution on a filtered dataset and released the code and weights. 
It is designed to generate photorealistic images using text captions as a prompt. The model is trained on the same dataset and the same model architecture as DALL-E.
